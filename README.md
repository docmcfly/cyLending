# TYPO3 extension :: cyLending

With this extension you can organize the lending of objects. Front-end users can submit a loan request for one or more objects for a certain period of time. This request can go through a simple approval process or can also be approved automatically. A calendar shows which objects are already on loan and for which there are requests.
A warning is issued for loans that overlap in time. External appointment sources can also be integrated using a hook.
